# Personality in your code

I've been programming for a few years now, and every once in a while, this question pops up: how much personality should my program have?

The first time I remember thinking about this was shortly after I released Musicly. I was showing my dad around the app, and at some point, he noticed a joke I'd made on the search bar. He thought that I should remove it since jokes lack professionalism and could convey the wrong impression to the users. Sure enough, I took it out.

I kept on programming, and whenever the choice of a humorous sentence or feature came up, I used to stick to the safe and dull side of professionalism. And then I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSg0F3hwMnE&t) on Computerphile which totally changed my mind on the subject. Marco Arment's argument that indie developpers should embrace their personality resonated with me and made me proud to add a personal touch to my apps.

Today, I firmly stand on the personal side of the discussion. It's fair to say that this video has shaped my behavior in the programming world. I hope you give it a try!

P.S: There are three other videos on Computerphile with Marco Arment. All are very interesting and funny to watch - I can't help but love this guy! [#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVRtJbXQsL8) [#2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH1XF0tOFsQ) [#3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy5pzN-wLxg)
